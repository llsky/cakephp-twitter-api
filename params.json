Install Abrahams twitteroauth library (I have forked the version I used - https://github.com/voycey/twitteroauth) into app/Vendor/twitteroauth (so you should have app/Vendor/twitteroauth/twitteroauth)\r\n2. Clone this repository into app/Plugin/Twitter\r\n3. Import the SQL file into your database using whatever method you prefer\r\n4. Edit app/Plugin/Config/bootstrap.php and put in your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret that you obtained from http://dev.twitter.com and your screen name.\r\n\r\n\r\nSet-up\r\n------\r\n\r\nOk so now you have the files in place you need to authorise your app with twitter:\r\n\r\n1. Go to yourdomain.com/Twitter/authorise_twitter\r\n2. Login with your twitter details if asked if not you should be redirected back to the homepage and your app is now authorised.\r\n\r\n##### If you weren't redirected back to the homepage then you have probably missed a step - recheck.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe basic usage of this is to instantiate a copy of the model (with either loadModel or by putting it in your $uses array) and then either use the GET or POST methods provided against whichever twitter end point you want:\r\nhttps://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Basic Examples:\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest usage of it - the default get() method fetches the tweets of the screen name you entered in bootstrap.php\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->loadModel('Twitter.Twitter');\r\n$twitter = $this->Twitter->get();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will get a different users 7 latest tweets:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->loadModel('Twitter.Twitter');\r\n$twitter = $this->Twitter->get('statuses/user_timeline', array('screen_name' => 'voycey', 'count' => 7));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd obviously you can do POST requests aswell, This will post an awesome message to your Twitter!\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->loadModel('Twitter.Twitter');\r\n$twitter = $this->Twitter->post();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will post a custom message to your Twitter:\r\n```php\r\n$this->loadModel('Twitter.Twitter');\r\n$twitter = $this->Twitter->post('statuses/update',array('status'=>'This is an awesome status message');\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### See the full list of endpoints at https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1\r\n\r\n#### There are also some handy functions I have put in Twitter.Helper:\r\n\r\nThis will take the text of a tweet and parse all of the links, hashtags and usernames into links (courtesy of http://saturnboy.com/2010/02/parsing-twitter-with-regexp/), pass in the twitter->text part and it will output a\r\nnicely formatted html snippet of the tweet.\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function parse_tweet($tweet_text) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have also added in a time calculator so you have Twitters \"Posted 20h ago\" or \"Posted 3 days ago\"\r\n\r\n```php \r\nfunction time_ago($date,$granularity=2) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHope this helps - feel free to use / abuse this - since Twitter took all their public access off it can be quite confusing getting started with it\r\n\r\n#### Custom Settings Table\r\n\r\nIf you want to use your own Settings Table you can change the $useTable variable in the Twitter Model and then make sure you change lines 50 onwards of TwittersController.php to match your databsase table structure.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
